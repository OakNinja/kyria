This case supports MX and Choc switches. A file for a plate that supports ALPS cases is also available, though it doesn't support the tenting puck.

To make a case, you'll need to cut the following files out of 3mm thick acrylic:

- 2 × Base
- 2 × Plate
- 2 × Guard

Furthermore, you'll need:

- 36 × 5mm M2 machine screw
- 14 × 6mm M2 round spacer
- 4 × 12mm M2 round spacer
