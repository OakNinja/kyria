This case supports MX switches only. A plate is also available for ALPS switches, though that doesn't support the tenting puck.

To make a case, you'll need to cut the following out of 3mm thick acrylic:

- 2 × Bottom
- 4 × Mid
- 2 × Plate
- 2 × Top 1
- 2 × Top 2
- 2 × Guard

Alternatively when not using OLED displays, you can cut 2 × Integrated Guard instead of 2 × Top 2 and 2 × Guard.

Furthermore, you'll need:

- 36 × 8mm M2 machine screw
- 18 × 10mm M2 round spacer
